# A block defined with a class name inside the < and > characters is a Widget rule. It will be applied to any 
# instance of the named class. If you replaced PongGame with Widget in our example, all Widget instances would have 
# the vertical line and the two Label widgets inside them because it would define these rules for all Widget instances.

# You will find that Kivy's design syntax is similar to normal CSS.

<PongGame>:
    # Canvas section in which you can add Graphics instructions that define how the widget is rendered.
    canvas:
        # We add a rectangle to the canvas
        Rectangle:
            # We set the pos of the rectangle to be 5 pixels left of the horizontal center of the widget (x), 
            # and 0 for y (vertical)
            pos: self.center_x - 5, 0
            # The size of the rectangle is set to 10 pixels in width, and the widgetâ€™s height in height.
            size: 10, self.height

    # Adds a Label widget as a child widget to the PongGame widget (parent/root widget)       
    Label:
        font_size: 70
        # The root keyword can be used inside the child block to refer back to the parent/root widget the rule applies  
        center_x: root.width / 4
        top: root.top - 50
        text: "0"

    Label:
        font_size: 70  
        center_x: root.width * 3 / 4
        top: root.top - 50
        text: "0"
